# Flask Voice API

To get this app up and running (pun intended), fork and clone this repository. After the clone, run `source ./venv/bin/activate` to install the pip dependencies for the app.

Run `flask run` to get it all started.


Currently, I only have a `basic` function. The API interacts with AT Voice giving caller different options with the different Digits combination to dial. Just learning to interact with the API, more features will come in later.
